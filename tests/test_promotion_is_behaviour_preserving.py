"""A promoted capability is opt-in, and this is the proof rather than the claim.

When a script already in this registry gains a capability from a consuming
benchmark, the deal is always the same: **every new parameter defaults to what
the script did before**, so the graphs already running it do not move. That
sentence is easy to write and easy to get wrong -- an added call, a reordered
pair of statements, a default that is nearly the old literal.

So it is checked the way ``staging_parity`` checks its side: drive the script as
it was at a pinned git ref and as it is now, over a grid of inputs, through a
recording fake, and require the **full sequence of tool calls** -- names and
keyword values -- plus the return value and any raised error to match exactly.

Only the defaults are compared. What the new parameters do when a caller asks
for them is the subject of the behaviour tests beside this file; what is
asserted here is that a caller who does not ask gets the old script.
