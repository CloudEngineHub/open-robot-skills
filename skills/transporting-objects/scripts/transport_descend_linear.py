"""Straight-Z placement INTO a walled container: lift (Z) → XY over the
container → LINEAR descend to inside the walls.

The generalized form of the reference packing recipe, for any container with
an interior (basket, bin, box, tote). Lift/XY are straight-line cartesian
(``robot.go_to_pose_cartesian``); the descend uses cuRobo's AXIS-CONSTRAINED
linear move (``curobo.plan_directed_linear``, ``allowed_axes=["Z"]``,
``orientation_mode="LOCK"``) — a guaranteed straight vertical drop. The descend
lowers the TCP to ``container_top − place_offset`` (with ``place_offset`` small
or negative to sit just above the rim so the held object clears the walls on the
way down and drops in) so the object is placed IN the container, not from a
lateral swing. For placement ONTO a surface or into a described sub-region/zone,
use the ``compute_drop_pose → waypoint_move → descend_release_linear`` path
instead — this script is the walled-container fast path.

Heights are derived, not resting literals: with ``lift_z`` / ``transport_z``
left at their ``-1.0`` sentinels both come from the perceived container's rim
and the wrist's current height, so the same script places on a table at any
height. Every cartesian leg is checked against ``robot.get_ee_pose`` afterwards
(a servo that stops 3 cm short is a leg that did not happen), and the lateral
leg searches the container's reachable interior when its centre is out of
reach.

    """Turn the held object's long axis to lie along the container's long one.

    **This is not a wrist-yaw search.** A sweep that probes a ladder of yaws
    with a planner, looking for one it will accept, is a measured dead end: the
    planner refuses almost everything and is not a feasibility oracle, and such
    a sweep spent 24 probes per give-up and rescued nothing. This computes ONE
    angle from geometry, asks no planner, and is about whether the object FITS
    rather than whether the arm can get there.

    Both facts it needs are already to hand. A grasp frame built with local Y
    along the object's fitted linear feature means the rotation the hand is
    already carrying names the object's long axis -- column 1 of its matrix --
    so nothing extra has to be wired in. The container's own long axis is
    whichever of ``extent.x``/``extent.y`` is bigger.

    Without this the release yaw is inherited from wherever the object happened
    to be lying when it was picked up, which in a scattered bin is arbitrary. A
    compartment 180 x 230 mm inside will not take a 200 mm tool crosswise: at
    the wrong yaw it comes down across a divider rather than into a cell, and
    since a placement predicate scores the body's centre against the region,
    which way it then topples decides the outcome. Nothing raises when that
    happens, which is why it is worth spending a rotation to avoid.

    POST-multiplied, never pre-multiplied. Pre-multiplying by Rz spins a tilted
    approach around a cone and moves where the tool points; post-multiplying
    turns the tool about its own approach axis and leaves the approach exactly
    where it was.

    Returns ``None`` when no turn is wanted -- the long axis is already nearer
    the container's long axis than its short one, or points so close to
    vertical that its heading is not meaningful. ``None`` means "keep the grasp
    rotation", which is what the caller does unconditionally without this.

    compartment-sorting tier where the tool centre was not a good enough proxy
    for the object:

    ``target_obb``
        The box of the thing in the jaws. Given one, the carry height clears
        the object's UNDERSIDE rather than the tool centre (``surface_inset_m``
        says how far it hangs), and the interior margins keep the OBJECT inside
        the walls (``cell_clearance_m`` is the gap left beside it). Left
        ``None``, hang is zero and the margins collapse to the symmetric inset,
        which is the old rule exactly.
    ``carry_cap_m``
        Where height stops being free. Horizontal reach is a circle about the
        base whose radius depends on tool height; measured on one cell over
        z = 0.84..1.36 it peaks across z = 0.96..1.00 and falls away above, so
        the extra height an object's hang asks for is capped before it starts
        costing the reach that placement is already short of.
    ``align_to_container``
        Turn the object's long axis onto the container's long axis during the
        lift, so the turn costs no separate motion. See ``_aligned_rotation``.
    ``level_lift``
        Lift to the full carry height before translating instead of to a
        centimetre below it. The lateral leg is a Cartesian servo, so a lift
        that stops short does not stay short -- it turns the crossing into a
        diagonal that climbs while traversing, which is the one stretch where a
        held object rides lowest over the dividers.
